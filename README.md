A Swift Package Manager wrapper that allows the creation of macOS apps with Swift packages instead of Xcode projects. My end goal is to be able to create apps for Windows, Linux and macOS with a single Swift codebase. You may also be interested in [SwiftCrossUI](https://github.com/stackotter/swift-cross-ui), a UI framework with a similar goal.
